## My process
- Used HTML,CSS & Javascript for this project
- I started sketching the layout on a piece of paper than afterwards I created the desktop layout than then the mobile layout.

### Built with
- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- for CSS I used a combination of Grid and Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to use Grid. Since I prefer using flexbox most of the time I havenlt used Grid that much. Inorder to have the New section and main headline section next to each while maintaining there sizes it Grid was the best choice for the job.


### Continued development

I need to focus on making more responsive and try using mobile first approach to develop my solution since many people use their phones to access sites.

I also need to practice using grid more often.


### Useful resources

- W3-school and Youtube helped me learn grid and they're great resources for learning new topics in a way that will save time
